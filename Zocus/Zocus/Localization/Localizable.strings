Please Follow These Steps:

1. Dismount your lens before starting this App. If you have not done this, dismount and re-start the App.

2. Position the Zoom and Focus rings roughly in the middle of their operational range, e.g. if you have a 28mm-300mm, set the Zoom to ~130mm.
Do similarly for the Focus also.

3. Now mount the Lens.

In the next screen you will define the Min and Max ranges for both the Zoom and the Focus.
The Default is the largest possible Min-Max range that the servos can handle. Save alternatives under My Lenses.
